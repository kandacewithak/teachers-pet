Teacher's Pet

Teacher's Pet is a curated gift generator that users can browse to get ideas for presents for their teachers.  
The app uses the Etsy API to provide the gift options.  Users are able to search for a specific teacher (eg. math teacher) to curate their gift ideas.

Teacher's Pet was built using JavaScript/jQuery and the Etsy API.  Initially, I completed a paired bootcamp project where we 
built an app called Giftify that used the Etsy API to generate gift ideas based on the category of items that the user was 
shopping for.  From this project, I got the idea for Teacher's Pet and was able to modify & refactor the code to build a
similar but more curated application.
